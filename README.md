## About
According to the wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
John Conway's Game of life follows the following rules.
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
